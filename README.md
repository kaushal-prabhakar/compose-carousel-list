# RecyclerView with Auto-Scrolling Carousel in Jetpack Compose #


## Overview ##

This is a simple Jetpack Compose-based Android app featuring a RecyclerView with a horizontally scrolling carousel as the first item. The carousel auto-scrolls but stops on user interaction and resumes when scrolled back to the top. The rest of the items scroll vertically in the list.


## Features ##

✅ Jetpack Compose UI – 100% Compose-based implementation.

✅ Auto-scrolling Carousel – Automatically moves between items on app start.

✅ User Interaction Handling – Stops auto-scroll when navigated manually or RecyclerView is scrolled.

✅ State Persistence – Remembers the last carousel item and resumes auto-scroll when returning to the top of the list.
